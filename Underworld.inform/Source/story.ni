"Underworld" by Devin Weaver

[Designer's Notes:
	To end the game let's get persephone and hecate together. Persephone says hecate is ugly because all she does is smoke. So we convince persephone to folow us to hecate. They argue and that distracts hecate. Then kick the huka and break it. If you wait persephone walks off. Otherwise hecate changes and they kiss. And you win!]
