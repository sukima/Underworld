	now the description entry is "This was a guided meditation that I had during a Samhain ritual. The idea was to travel to the underworld and visit a few key players. When I took the journey I developed a stage that look similar to Bilbo Baggins hobbit hut from the Lord of The Rings movie. I met Cerberus, Hecate, and Persephone there. I had to give the characters a gift (something I didn't want). Each gift I gave them let me either pass or I was given a bit of advise. Eventually I made it to Persephone who ascended me back to the real world.[paragraph break]I wrote this to help me learn Inform 7 and writing a cohesive story. I hope you like it and ask only that if you did enjoy this work to consider sending me a 'Hey, that was cool' email. I could use the self esteem boost.

"Imbolc"	--	"I can't believe it. I met someone today. She is so pretty. I was out in the garden tending to some flowers when I heard Cerberus barking. When I looked up I saw he the color of the sun, the moon, and fire all at the same time. Her body shaped to please anyone men, women, and animal. I was in awe and had to force myself to close my mouth as she approached.[paragraph break]I think I blushed when she greeted me. I asked her what she was doing in this part of the multiverse and she explained how she had gotten lost and really had no where to go but to walk. I asked if she wanted to come inside and relax for a while. I offered tea.[paragraph break]She told me all about the world of magic from her past and I told her all about myself (blushing of course). I even offered her to stay over night. She was very happy and I was infatuated with her smile."
"Ostara"	--	"So I offered Hecate a place to stay for a while. It seemed a nice thing to do. Even so I have to admit the offer was a bit selfish. I asked her out on a date. I nearly fainted when she said 'Yes'.[paragraph break]I went to work right away with the cooks to make the best dinner ever. I instructed them on making the perfect soup. I was so happy to have a date with Hecate.[paragraph break]To bad the cooks can't make soup. Sigh, It was a disaster. I nearly spit the soup all over poor Hecate. Strangely she loved the soup. I just don't get it but we laughed till we fell asleep in each other's arms."
"Beltane"	--	"Tonight was the most amazing nigt ever. Hecate and I spent the day picking flowers and playing little tickle games. Then she kissed me! Oh, I can not begin to explain how electrifying it was. I love her so much. We layed down together and found was of pleasing eachother that I didn't know could exists. I will never forget this night. Sigh."
"Litha"	--	"Oh I can't begin to understand this. I got so upset I ran out of the house crying with Cerberus running after me. I thought I messed the whole thing up. I woke and Hecate was gone. I knew it was too good to be true. I must have moved to fast or maybe I forced myself on her. Oh dear! maybe it was my comment about her mess that used to be her dresser! Oh everything has gone to hell.[paragraph break]Hecate returned to see me sobbing on th bed. I was so scared to see her I nearly jumped under the bed. TODO"
