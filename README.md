## Compile Errors ##

If you atempt to move from one system to another you can run into some
incompatabilities with the different versions of inform7 applications.

Your compiler will probubly fail when you run it for the first time. If
that is the case you need update your settings or run the shell script
`fixsettings.sh` which will convert the Settings.plist from an Apple based
one to a Gnome (linux) one.

If your on a mac and still feel that you need to patch then run
`fixsettings.sh -f`
