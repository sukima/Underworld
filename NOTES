Hi there.  I have finished your game.  I liked it for the most part, I just think it needs more polish and some more fleshing out of the world, situation and main character.  There are a few spelling mistakes but that's to be expected, it was nothing major and didn't detract from the game.  I took the liberty of pointing them out in my comments in the transcript.

I think that the main character needs more developement and perhaps some back story.  Also, given that the world he/she is in is quite odd and unusual, some more information about the world itself and/or how the main character got there would be nice.  Doing that would get the player involved and immersed much more and get them invested in the characters(s).  Also, room descriptions are a little sparce and not very detailed.  I'm sure you know that, good, detailed room descriptions are very important in IF.

The ongoing puzzle mechanic of giving sins to NPCs as the solution is original but very easy and simplistic.  I would have liked to have seen more items and more creative ways to use them. I was thinking one way to make the sins mechanic more clever and creative would be to link what the sin actually is to something that is does when given to an NPC.  For example, giving Sloth to Cerberus could make him lazy and fall asleep allowing the player to pass because laziness is what Sloth is.

There's also some info pertaining to solutions in the game that seem to be missing or hard to find.  For example, it took me a long while to find the exact command to place the door knob in the wooden door, I didn't find a way to find out the strange woman's name, I didn't find the exact right command to get Persephone to follow me to the Huka Hut and there is seemingly no way to find out that the player has to hit the huka.  I didn't even know about the diary until you mentioned it in your previous email and even after I knew about it, there didn't seem to be any info on where it was let alone how to get it.

Attached is the transcript of my playthrough with all my comments/annotations in it.  All of which are denoted with an asterisk.  I hope you found my test of your game useful and if you have any questions about anything I've said, my ideas etc. please feel free to email me anytime.

The first thing you want to do when starting a game is acquaint yourself with your surroundings and get a sense of your goal. To this end, you should read the introductory text carefully. Sometimes it contains clues. You will also want to look at the room you are in. Notice where the exits from the room are, and what objects are described here. If any of these seem interesting, you may want to EXAMINE them. 

You might also want to examine yourself (EXAMINE ME) to see whether the author has left you any clues about your character. TAKE INVENTORY will tell you what you're carrying, as well.

Once you've gotten your bearings, you may want to explore. Move from room to room, and check out every location available.

There are a few simple commands for controlling the game itself. These are: 

SAVE saves a snapshot of the game as it is now. 
RESTORE puts the game back to a previous saved state. You may keep as many saved games as you like. 
RESTART puts the game back to the way it was at the beginning. 
QUIT ends the game.

Reread. Look back at things you've already looked at. Sometimes this will trigger an idea you hadn't thought of. 

Take hints from the prose of the game. Things that are described in great detail are probably more important than things that are given one-liners. Play with those objects. If a machine is described as having component parts, look at the parts, and try manipulating them.  Likewise, notice the verbs that the game itself uses. Try using those yourself. Games often include special verbs -- the names of magic spells, or other special commands. There's no harm in attempting something if the game mentions it.

Check the whole screen. Are there extra windows besides the main window?  What's going on in those?  Check out the status bar, if there is one -- it may contain the name of the room you're in, your score, the time of day, your character's state of health, or some other important information.  If there's something up there, it's worth paying attention to that, too.  When and where does it change?  Why is it significant?  If the bar is describing your character's health, you can bet there is probably a point at which that will be important.

Rephrase. If there's something you want to do, but the game doesn't seem to understand you, try alternative wordings. 

Try variations. Sometimes an action doesn't work, but does produce some kind of unusual result. These are often indications that you're on the right track, even if you haven't figured out quite the right approach yet. Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and then the red will open the secret door.

Consider the genre of the game. Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation. What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that? What's the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Main Hall
A room devoid of any home pleasantries. It seems it is used purely to move to and from the four adjoining rooms. To the east is a room bellowing out smoke. To the north is a small dinner.

Thank you for taking the time to test this game. This is my first game and although I don't have a huge investment in it (It's not meant for competition). I would like feedback in general. I'm looking for bog, typos, game play feedback so I can make this one a bit better and more importantly general feedback so I make future games better.

A few notes:
Before you begin playing please start a transcript by typing the command SCRIPT.

Persephone's Chamber
A large chamber made of crystal. Clear clean light descends from the crystal walls. The only exit is back to the south.

You can see Persephone and a throne here.

Persephone starts crying. She stops pacing to compose herself before continuing her pacing.

Pathway to Ascension
A beautiful hall that is covered in green, blue, and purple silk fabric. The fabric is flowing gently even though there is no breeze. You see an entrance to a large chamber to the north. And the glow of the Main Hall flows in from the east.

Main Hall
A room devoid of any home pleasantries. It seems it is used purely to move to and from the four adjoining rooms. To the east is a room bellowing out smoke. To the north is a small dinner. To the west is a large and beautiful ornate door. And your way back to the vestibule is to the south. There is also a small doorway to the southwest that you almost missed at first glance.

>e

Huka hut
This room has large cushions laying about the floor. All of then colored in tie die. The room is filled with smoke. No doubt from the large Huka standing in the center of the room.

You can see the Huka and a strange woman here.

The strange woman seems to be lost in thought.

>ask strange woman to apologise
I didn't understand that sentence.

>ask strange woman about arguement
After a long pause while she puffed on the Huka, she turns to you to say "I can not conjecture on that now."

The strange woman coughs and then clears her throat.

You can see Persephone and a throne here.

Persephone sits back down on the throne and leans on her elbow.

>ask persephone about talking to hecate
She says "OK, I'll try it. Take me to her."

* There is seemingly no info on how to find out the strange woman's name.  The only way I found out her name was from the hints.  Finding the solution of having to get Persephone to follow the player needs to be made much clearer.  Also, there needs to be more commands allowing the player to do so.  For example,"ask persephone to follow" 
Annotation noted.

Persephone looks nervous

A large bottle shaped device stands in the middle of the room. It has several tubes coming out of it, water inside and smoke emanating from the top.

Persephone says "Well your always so consumed by the damn thing."

>x persephone
You recognize her as Persephone. She is so beautiful that you are in awe of her beauty. Long silk white hair flows like water down her neck and back. Her eyes the color of deep green. Simply angelic.

the strange woman shouts "See I told you so. Now get out!" and she sits back down and takes another puff of the Huka.

>hit huka
You break the Huka. Shards of glass fall to the floor. The fire that produced the smoke is extinguished when it falls in the large puddle of water. The strange woman turns in horror at the mess. Persephone is silent.

* The solution of hitting the huka needs to be made much clearer.  There is seemingly no way of finding out that is what you have to do apart from looking at the hints.
Annotation noted.

The strange woman was about to say something when her body suddenly changes. Her wrinkles go away. Her nose returns to a normal size. Even her eyes seem to brighten up. She becomes quite beautiful.

Persephone exclaims "Hecate! You? Oh my! You look how I remember you did before we got that terrible Huka."

the strange woman looks back at Persephone and says "I? I feel so different. What happened? Persephone, I? I'm so sorry.

Persephone replies with a gentle smile "Oh it so good to have you back Hecate." And she quickly kisses the strange woman.

Persephone turns to you and says "Thank you so very much. I will return you from where you came. You will always have our blessings."
Persephone approaches you and takes your hand. She kisses your forehead and you find yourself awake in the Shaman's hut. You feel relieved of your burdens and with a smile you trot out of the hut to enjoy your life.



    *** The End ***


In that game you scored 55 out of a possible 50, in 133 turns, earning you the rank of an enlightened mind.

* Score seems to be glitched.  According to the above, I have more points than is possible to actually get.
